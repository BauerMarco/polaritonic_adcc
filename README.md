Polaritonic_adcc is a python-based framework, which can be seen as an extension to the adcc package, with the purpose of computing the polaritonic perturbation theoretical electronic structure of molecules and clusters using MP, ADC and UCC.

The corresponding paper can be found here:

If you use this package for a scientific publication, please cite the above paper.

The documentation, including information on installation and usage, can be found
under the following url: https://bauermarco.github.io/polaritonic_adcc/

Due to errors with the remote setup of the API documentation, you still have
to build it locally, if you are interested in that. In order to do so, pip
install the packages listed in docs/requirements.txt and then execute "make html"
from the docs directory. Now you can open the genindex.html (along with the
remaining documentation) in the new build directory with any browser you like.
